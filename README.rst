===================
Solid Arch Dotfiles
===================

A set of elegant dotfiles in the spirit of Arch Linux that will give
you a development boon. These are kept as sharp as possible by constant
use and honing.

+ A slick `vimrc`_ ideal for Python, Django and Vue.js development.
+ `Aliases`_ for networking, pacman, statistics etc.
+ `Functions`_ for controlling services, extracting/compressing files, encryption etc.


Installation
------------
This **will not** overwrite any of your existing dotfiles. It will tell
you which conflicting files you have to move before re-trying the
install again.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ curl -L https://git.io/vybNs 2> /dev/null | python -
